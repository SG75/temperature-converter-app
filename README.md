# Temperature Converter App

The Temperature Converter app simplifies temperature conversions between Celsius and Fahrenheit, harnessing JavaScript's powerful features such as classes, switch statements, and try-catch statements to enhance user interaction.

## JavaScript Concepts Applied

### Classes

We employ JavaScript classes to structure and manage temperature conversion functions. Our `TemperatureConverter` class streamlines the conversion logic, promoting code organization and reusability.

### Switch Statements

Switch statements guide the app through diverse conversion scenarios. When you choose a temperature scale (Celsius or Fahrenheit), a switch statement directs the app to the corresponding conversion method. This versatile control flow structure efficiently handles different cases.

### Try-Catch Statements

For robust error handling, we implement try-catch statements. Should you input an invalid temperature value or face a conversion error, the try-catch block captures and gracefully manages the issue. This safeguards user experience amidst unexpected inputs or errors.

## Step-by-Step Usage

### Step 1: Open the App

Access the Temperature Converter web page in your browser:

### Step 2: Enter Temperature Value

1. Locate the "Temperature Value" input field.
2. Input your temperature value, ensuring it's a valid number.

### Step 3: Select Conversion Scale

1. Find the "Convert to" dropdown below the temperature input.
2. Click the dropdown to reveal your scale choices:
   - **Celsius**: Converts to degrees Celsius.
   - **Fahrenheit**: Converts to degrees Fahrenheit.

### Step 4: Perform the Conversion

1. After entering the temperature and choosing the scale, spot the "Convert" button.
2. Click "Convert" to trigger the conversion.

### Step 5: View the Result

1. Upon completion, the converted temperature, along with the chosen scale, is displayed on the web page.
2. Any errors appear in red text beneath the result.

### Step 6: Start a New Conversion

For another conversion:

1. Enter a fresh temperature value.
2. Pick your desired conversion scale.
3. Click "Convert" again for the new conversion.

## Notes

- Invalid temperature entries (e.g., non-numeric characters) trigger an error message. Ensure valid numbers for accurate conversions.

- The app utilizes JavaScript's classes, switch statements, and try-catch statements for conversion and error handling.

- Employ this app effortlessly to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit, serving diverse purposes.
